# Even Better Artisan Good Icons

This newly updated Better Artisan Good Icons mod will soon be uploaded to Nexus, before that you could download the mod at release page. The original mod (now outdated) can be found [here](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2080?).


## How it works

The mod overwrites the corresponding draw functions for artisan goods using [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony), and then draws the right texture for them based on what was used to make them. 

Note that this repo does not contain the Harmony dll.

## For user

For the ease of maintaining this mod, the unique id of this mod was updated to **haze1nuts.evenbetterartisangoodicons**.

To use other content pack that is created for original BAGI along with this base mod, please replace the contant pack dependency from **cat.betterartisangoodicons** to **haze1nuts.evenbetterartisangoodicons**, in the content pack's manifest.json.

## Future Update

Currently, this mod only update icons for Wine, Juice, Jelly, Pickle and Honey. It will support 1.6 goods like dried mushroom and dried fruit very soon!
