# Even Better Artisan Good Icons

an updated mod to Better Artisan Good Icons (originally created by danvolchek). Link to download can be found on [Nexus](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22144?).


## How it works

The mod overwrites the corresponding draw functions for artisan goods using [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony), and then draws the right texture for them based on what was used to make them. 

Note that this repo does not contain the Harmony dll.

To use other content pack that is created for original BAGI along with this base mod, please replace the contant pack dependency from **cat.betterartisangoodicons** to **haze1nuts.evenbetterartisangoodicons**, in the content pack's manifest.json.

## Future Update
